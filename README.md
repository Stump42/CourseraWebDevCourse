### History
Meh. Didn't type much. Look up site. HTML, W3C, Can I use .com, browser statistics on w3 schools. 

### Rules
Some tags do not have closing tags. Such as: <br> line break and <hr> horizontal rule.

Attributes are things that are usually predefined for tags, such as id in <p id="my Id"></p>. Single and double quotes are allowed for attribute values.

Self closing tag <p/>. (does it work for p?). Don't use if you intend to add content to it later.

### Elements
Block level elements: Render to begin on a new line by default
may contain inline or other block level elements

Inline Elements: render on the same line by default.
may only contain other inline elements.
